<br>
<b><font size="3">Tablet</font></b></p><ul>
<li>
<font size="3">Take your medicine as directed. Your dose may need to be changed several times to find what works best for you. It may take 3 to 6 weeks of using this medicine before you start to feel better.</font>
</li>
<li>
<font size="3">This medicine should come with a Medication Guide. Ask your pharmacist for a copy if you do not have one. </font>
</li>
<li>
<font size="3"><b>Missed dose: </b>Take a dose as soon as you remember. If it is almost time for your next dose, wait until then and take a regular dose. Do not take extra medicine to make up for a missed dose. </font>
</li>
<li>
<font size="3">Store the medicine in a closed container at room temperature, away from heat, moisture, and direct light. </font>
</li>
</ul><p><b><font size="4">Drugs and Foods to Avoid:</font></b>
<br>
<b><font size="3">Ask your doctor or pharmacist before using any other medicine, including over-the-counter medicines, vitamins, and herbal products.</font></b></p><ul>

These medicines used together could cause serious health problems, including death. <b>Ask your doctor before you use any other medicine.</b> You may need to wait 1 to 5 weeks before you can use the other medicine.</font>
</li>
<li>
<font size="3">Do not use isocarboxazid if you have used another MAO inhibitor within the past 14 days.
