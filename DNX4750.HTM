<br>
<b><font size="3">Testosterone (tes-TOS-ter-one)</font></b></p><p>
<b><font size="3">Treats low testosterone levels.</font></b>
</p><p><b><font size="4">             Brand Name(s):             </font></b><b>Androderm</b>
<br>
<font size="3">There may be other brand names for this medicine.</font></p><p><b><font size="4">When This Medicine Should Not Be Used:</font></b>
<br>
<font size="3">This medicine is not right for everyone. Do not use it if you had an allergic reaction to testosterone, or if you have breast cancer or prostate cancer.</font></p><p><b><font size="4">How to Use This Medicine:</font></b>
<br>
<b><font size="3">Patch</font></b></p><ul>
<li>
<font size="3">Your doctor will tell you how many patches to use, where to apply them, and how often to apply them. Do not use more patches or apply them more often than your doctor tells you to. </font>
</li>
<li>
<font size="3">Read and follow the patient instructions that come with this medicine. Talk to your doctor or pharmacist if you have any questions. </font>
</li>
<li>
<font size="3">Wash your hands with soap and water before and after applying a patch. </font>
</li>
<li>
<font size="3">Leave the patch in its sealed wrapper until you are ready to put it on. Tear the wrapper open carefully. NEVER CUT the wrapper or the patch with scissors. Do not use any patch that has been cut by accident. </font>
</li>
<li>
<font size="3">The patient instructions will show the body areas where you can wear the patch. When putting on each new patch, choose a different place within these areas. Do not put the new patch on the same place you wore the last one. Be sure to remove the old patch before applying a new one. </font>
</li>
<li>
<font size="3">Apply the patch to clean, dry skin with very little hair, on your back, abdomen, upper arms, or thighs. Apply the patch at about the same time every night.</font>
</li>
<li>
<font size="3">Do not put the patch over burns, cuts, or irritated skin. Do not put the patch on oily or sweaty skin or on a spot that might put extra pressure on it (such as over a joint).</font>
</li>
<li>
<font size="3">Bathing or swimming should not affect the patch. However, wait at least 3 hours after you apply the patch before you wash the skin area or shower or swim. Heavy exercise and sweating may cause the patch to fall off.</font>
</li>
<li>
<font size="3">If the patch becomes loose, smooth it down and press it back onto your skin. If the patch comes off <b>before</b> 12 o'clock noon, put on a new patch, and then replace the new patch at your regular time. If the patch comes off <b>after</b> noon, just wait and put on a new patch at your next regular time. Do not tape the patch to your skin.</font>
</li>
<li>
<font size="3"><b>Missed dose: </b>If you forget to wear or change a patch, put one on as soon as you can. If it is almost time to put on your next patch, wait until then to apply a new patch and skip the one you missed.  Do not apply extra patches to make up for a missed dose. </font>
</li>
<li>
<font size="3">Store the patches at room temperature in a closed container, away from heat, moisture, and direct light. </font>
</li>
<li>
<font size="3">Fold the used patch in half with the sticky sides together.  Throw any used patch away so that children or pets cannot get to it. You will also need to throw away old patches after the expiration date has passed. </font>
</li>
<li>
<font size="3">Keep the medicine in a safe place. Do not give it to anyone else, even if you have the same symptoms.</font>
</li>
