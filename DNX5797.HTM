<b><font size="3">Prevents asthma attacks. This medicine contains a steroid.</font></b>
</p><p><b><font size="4">             Brand Name(s):             </font></b><b>Dulera</b>
<br>
<font size="3">There may be other brand names for this medicine.</font></p><p><b><font size="4">When This Medicine Should Not Be Used:</font></b>
<br>
<font size="3">This medicine is not right for everyone. Do not use this medicine if you had an allergic reaction to mometasone or formoterol. Do not use this medicine if your asthma attack has already started.</font></p><p><b><font size="4">How to Use This Medicine:</font></b>
<br>
<b><font size="3">Powder Under Pressure</font></b></p><ul>
<li>
<font size="3">Take your medicine as directed. Your dose may need to be changed several times to find what works best for you. </font>
</li>
<li>
<font size="3">You will use this medicine with a device called a metered-dose inhaler. The inhaler fits on the medicine canister and turns the medicine into a fine spray that you breathe in through your mouth and to your lungs. You may be told to use a spacer, which is a tube that is placed between the inhaler and your mouth. Your caregiver will show you how to use your inhaler and the spacer (if needed). </font>
</li>
<li>
<font size="3">Do not remove the canister from the actuator.</font>
</li>
<li>
<font size="3">Remove the cap and look at the mouthpiece to make sure it is clean. </font>
</li>
<li>
<font size="3"><b>Prime the inhaler:</b> Before you use an inhaler for the first time, prime it by pointing it away from your face and spraying into the air 4 times. If the inhaler has not been used for 5 days or longer, prime it again.</font>
</li>
<li>
<font size="3">Always shake the inhaler right before you spray it, every time.</font>
</li>
<li>
<font size="3">To inhale this medicine, breathe out fully, trying to get as much air out of the lungs as possible. Put the mouthpiece just in front of your mouth with the canister upright. </font>
</li>
<li>
<font size="3">Open your mouth and breathe in slowly and deeply (like yawning), and at the same time firmly press down on the top of the canister once. </font>
</li>
<li>
<font size="3">Hold your breath for about 5 to 10 seconds, and then breathe out slowly. </font>
</li>
<li>
<font size="3">If you are supposed to use more than one puff, wait 1 to 2 minutes before inhaling the second puff. Repeat these steps for the next puff, starting with shaking the inhaler. </font>
</li>
<li>
<font size="3">When you have finished all your inhalations, rinse your mouth out with water. Do not swallow the water.</font>
</li>
<li>
<font size="3">Clean the inhaler mouthpiece daily with warm water. </font>
</li>
<li>
<font size="3">This medicine should come with a Medication Guide. Ask your pharmacist for a copy if you do not have one. </font>
</li>
<li>
<font size="3"><b>Missed dose: </b>Take a dose as soon as you remember. If it is almost time for your next dose, wait until then and take a regular dose. Do not take extra medicine to make up for a missed dose. </font>
</li>
<li>
<font size="3">Store the canister at room temperature, away from heat and direct light. Do not freeze. Do not keep this medicine inside a car where it could be exposed to extreme heat or cold. Do not poke holes in the canister or throw it into a fire, even if the canister is empty. Store the inhaler that has 60 doses with the mouthpiece down or sideways.</font>
</li>
<li>
<font size="3">Dispose of the inhaler when the counter reads "0" even if it feels like it still has medicine in it.</font>
</li>
</ul><p><b><font size="4">Drugs and Foods to Avoid:</font></b>
