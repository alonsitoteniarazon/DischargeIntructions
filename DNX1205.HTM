<b><font size="3">Injectable</font></b></p><ul>
<li>
<font size="3">Your doctor will prescribe your exact dose. Your dose may need to be changed several times in order to find out what works best for you. This medicine is given through a needle directly into your spinal cord.</font>

<li>
<font size="3">You will first be given 1 or 2 test doses, to see if this medicine will work for you. A nurse or other trained health professional will give you this test dose in a clinic or hospital.

</li>
<li>
