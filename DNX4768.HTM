<br>
<font size="3">This medicine is not right for everyone. Do not use it if you had an allergic reaction to testosterone, or if you have breast cancer or prostate cancer.</font></p><p><b><font size="4">How to Use This Medicine:</font></b>
<br>
<b><font size="3">Patch</font></b></p><ul>
<li>

</li>
<li>
<font size="3">Read and follow the patient instructions that come with this medicine. Talk to your doctor or pharmacist if you have any questions. </font>
</li>
<li>
<font size="3">This medicine looks like a tablet, but it sticks to your gum like a patch. To use the patch: <br>
<ul>
<li>
<font size="3">Put the flat side of the patch on your fingertip. Place the patch against your gum and to the left or right of your front teeth. Gently push it up as high as it will go. Then press on the patch from the outside of your lip for at least 30 seconds. The patch should stick to your gum.</font>
</li>
<li>
<font size="3">Do not chew or swallow the patch.</font>
</li>
<li>
<font size="3">Each time you put in a new patch, put it on the opposite side from where you put the last one.</font>
</li>
<li>
<font size="3">Keep the patch in your mouth all the time, unless you are changing patches. Check to make sure the patch is still in place after you eat or drink, use mouthwash, or brush your teeth.</font>
</li>
<li>
<font size="3">To remove a patch, use your finger to gently loosen it. Then slide it down over your teeth and take it out.</font>
</li>
<li>
<font size="3">Use this medicine 2 times a day, once in the morning and once in the evening (about 12 hours apart), unless your doctor tells you differently.</font>

<li>
<font size="3"><b>Missed dose: </b>If the patch falls off <b>within the first 8 hours</b>, take it out and put in a new one. Put in the next patch at the regular time. If the patch falls off after <b>more than 8 hours</b>, take it out and put in a new one. This will count as your next dose, and the patch can stay in place for 12 hours.</font>
