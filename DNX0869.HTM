<br>
<b><font size="3">Capsule</font></b></p><ul>
<li>
<font size="3">Your doctor will tell you how much medicine to use. Do not use more than directed. </font>
</li>
<li>
<font size="3">If you cannot swallow the capsule, you may open it and pour the medicine into a small amount of soft food such as pudding, yogurt, or applesauce. Stir this mixture well and swallow it without chewing. You can also pour the medicine beads into a spoon, swallow the beads, and then drink some fruit drink.</font>
</li>
<li>
<font size="3">Most people will use this medicine for a few weeks. If your symptoms come back after you stop using the medicine, you might need to wait a short time and then use the medicine again for a few weeks.</font>
</li>
<li>
<font size="3">The amount of medicine you take each day might change as your treatment proceeds. Make sure you understand how much medicine to take each day and when to take it. </font>
</li>
<li>
<font size="3">Drink plenty of water while you are using this medicine. Most people should drink 6 to 8, 8-ounce glasses of water every day. Ask your doctor if that is a proper amount of water for you. </font>
</li>
</ul>
<p>
<b><font size="3">If a dose is missed:</font></b>
</p>
<ul>
<li>
<font size="3">Take a dose as soon as you remember. If it is almost time for your next dose, wait until then and take a regular dose. Do not take extra medicine to make up for a missed dose. </font>
</li>
</ul>
<p>
<b><font size="4">How to Store and Dispose of This Medicine:</font></b>
</p>
<ul>
<li>
<font size="3">Store the medicine in a closed container at room temperature, away from heat, moisture, and direct light. </font>
</li>
<li>
<font size="3">Ask your pharmacist, doctor, or health caregiver about the best way to dispose of any outdated medicine or medicine no longer needed. </font>
</li>
<li>
<font size="3">Keep all medicine out of the reach of children. Never share your medicine with anyone. </font>
</li>
</ul><p><b><font size="4">Drugs and Foods to Avoid:</font></b>
<br>
<b><font size="3">Ask your doctor or pharmacist before using any other medicine, including over-the-counter medicines, vitamins, and herbal products.</font></b></p><ul>
<li>
<font size="3">Make sure your doctor knows if you are also using any other medicines to lower the amount of metal in your body, such as penicillamine (Cuprimine&#174;).</font>
