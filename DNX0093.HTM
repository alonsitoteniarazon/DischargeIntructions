<b><font size="3">Flunisolide (floo-NIS-oh-lide)</font></b></p><p>
<b><font size="3">Prevents asthma attacks. This medicine is a steroid.</font></b>
</p><p><b><font size="4">             Brand Name(s):             </font></b><b>Aerospan</b>
<br>
<font size="3">There may be other brand names for this medicine.</font></p><p><b><font size="4">When This Medicine Should Not Be Used:</font></b>
<br>
<font size="3">This medicine is not to be used during an asthma attack.</font></p><p><b><font size="4">How to Use This Medicine:</font></b>
<br>
<b><font size="3">Aerosol</font></b></p><ul>
<li>
<font size="3">Take your medicine as directed. Your dose may need to be changed several times to find what works best for you. </font>
</li>
<li>
<font size="3">This medicine is a powder that is used in adults and children who are 6 years of age and older. It is breathed in with a special inhaler device that comes with the medicine. The powder is stored inside this inhaler. You will use this medicine with a device called a metered-dose inhaler. The inhaler fits on the medicine canister and turns the medicine into a fine spray that you breathe in through your mouth and to your lungs. You may be told to use a spacer, which is a tube that is placed between the inhaler and your mouth. Your caregiver will show you how to use your inhaler and the spacer (if needed). </font>
</li>
<li>
<font size="3">Open and position the inhaler by pulling the built-in purple actuator out from the gray spacer and snap into an "L" shape before using it.</font>
</li>
<li>
<font size="3">The first time you use the inhaler, or if you have not used the inhaler for 2 weeks or longer, prime the inhaler before use by shaking it well and then releasing a test spray away from your eyes and face. Press down on the metal canister two times for one second each in order to release 2 test sprays into the air.</font>
</li>
<li>
<font size="3">To inhale this medicine, breathe out fully, trying to get as much air out of the lungs as possible. Put the mouthpiece just in front of your mouth with the canister upright. </font>
</li>
<li>
<font size="3">Open your mouth and breathe in slowly and deeply (like yawning), and at the same time firmly press down on the top of the canister once. </font>
</li>
<li>
<font size="3">Hold your breath for about 5 to 10 seconds, and then breathe out slowly. </font>
</li>
<li>
<font size="3">If your doctor has prescribed 2 or more sprays at each use, wait for 20 seconds, and follow exactly the same steps you used for the first puff.</font>
</li>
<li>
<font size="3">When you have finished all your inhalations, rinse your mouth out with water. You may also want to brush your teeth.</font>
</li>
<li>
<font size="3">Each inhaler comes with a Check-Off chart to track the number of puffs you have used. Mark off or check through each of your doses. Before you reach the last number of sprays, call your doctor to find out if you need a refill. You must discard the inhaler, actuator, and spacer after 60 sprays even if the canister is not empty. Do not place the canister under water to find out the amount of medicine still left in the canister.</font>
</li>
<li>
<font size="3">Read and follow the patient instructions that come with this medicine. Talk to your doctor or pharmacist if you have any questions. </font>
</li>
</ul>
<p>
<b><font size="3">If a dose is missed:</font></b>
</p>

</li>
