<br>
<font size="3"> You should not receive this medicine if you have had an allergic reaction to somatrem or if you have cancer or a growing tumor. This medicine is usually mixed with Bacteriostatic Water for Injection. You should not use Bacteriostatic Water for Injection if you have had an allergic reaction to benzyl alcohol. </font></p><p><b><font size="4">How to Use This Medicine:</font></b>
<br>
<b><font size="3">Injectable</font></b></p><ul>
<li>
<font size="3">Your doctor will prescribe your exact dose and tell you how often it should be given. This medicine is given as a shot under your skin, into a muscle, or into a vein. </font>
</li>
<li>
<font size="3">You may need to use this medicine for a long time, until you reach your final height and stop growing.</font>
</li>
<li>
<font size="3">You may see small specks or particles in the mixed medicine after it has been refrigerated. This is not unusual and the medicine can still be used.</font>
</li>
<li>
<font size="3">A nurse or other caregiver trained to give injections will give your treatment.</font>
</li>
<li>
<font size="3">Sometimes you or a family member can be taught how to give your medicine at home. Make sure you understand all instructions before giving an injection.</font>
</li>
<li>
<font size="3">This medicine is a powder that must be mixed with a special liquid before it is given. You should receive instructions on how to mix the medicine before injecting it. Follow these instructions carefully.</font>
</li>
<li>
<font size="3">The liquid usually used to mix with the powder contains benzyl alcohol. If you are allergic to benzyl alcohol, you may need to mix the powder with sterile water instead. Discuss this with your doctor.</font>

<li>
<font size="3">Always wipe the top of the medicine bottle with an alcohol pad before each use.</font>

<li>
<font size="3">To add the liquid to the powder, inject the water into the Protropin&#174; vial, aiming the stream of liquid against the glass wall of the vial.</font>

</li>
<li>
<font size="3">Pull the plunger until it lines up with the number of your dose on the side of the syringe.</font>
</li>
<li>
<font size="3">Gently tap the syringe with your finger to make any air bubbles float to the top of the syringe, just under the needle. Push the plunger in just enough so that the air bubbles go up into the bottle, and pull enough medicine back down into the syringe to make the correct dose.</font>
</li>

<font size="3">Use a new syringe for each shot. Never share syringes, needles, or medicine with anyone else.</font>
