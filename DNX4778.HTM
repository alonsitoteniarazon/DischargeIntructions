<br>
<b><font size="3">Injectable</font></b></p><ul>
<li>
<font size="3">Your doctor will decide how much of the solution you need and tell you how often it should be used. This solution is given through a catheter that is placed in your abdomen during a minor operation.</font>
</li>
<li>
<font size="3">Your caregiver should teach you about peritoneal dialysis and how to use this solution. Make sure you understand all instructions before you do the process yourself. <b>Follow all of the steps in the process exactly as you were trained to do</b>.</font>
</li>
<li>
<font size="3">This solution is for the long dwell exchange of peritoneal dialysis, which lasts longer than 8 hours. Do not use this solution more than 1 time in 24 hours, unless your doctor tells you to. You will have other solutions to use during shorter exchanges. </font>
</li>
<li>
<font size="3">Always wash your hands before you handle your catheter or medicine.</font>
