<li>
<font size="3">Read and follow the directions that come with your specific glucose test monitor, test strips, and lancet. </font>
</li>
<li>
<font size="3">Usually, you will use blood from your finger to do a blood sugar test. Some strips can also be used with blood from other sites (such as the side of the hand), but do not use another site unless the directions and your doctor say it is okay. </font>
</li>
<li>
<font size="3">Wash and dry your hands completely both before and after you do the test. </font>
</li>
<li>
<font size="3">Do not take a test strip out of the container until you are ready to do the test. The test strip might not give correct results if it is out of the container for more than a few minutes. </font>

<font size="3">Do not bend, cut, or tear the test strip, and do not use the test strip if it has been damaged in any way. </font>
</li>
<li>
<font size="3">Use each test strip only 1 time. </font>
</li>
<li>
<font size="3">Throw away all of your used supplies carefully. Other people could get sick if they come in contact with used testing supplies. </font>
