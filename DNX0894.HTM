<b><font size="3">Estradiol (es-tra-DYE-ol), Norethindrone (nor-ETH-in-drone)</font></b></p><p>
<b><font size="3">Treats hot flashes and other symptoms of menopause. Also supplements estrogen in women who do not have enough.</font></b>

<br>
<font size="3">There may be other brand names for this medicine.</font></p><p><b><font size="4">When This Medicine Should Not Be Used:</font></b>
<br>
<font size="3">This medicine is not right for everyone. Do not use it if you had an allergic reaction to estradiol or norethindrone, or if you are pregnant, have liver disease, bleeding problems, any type of cancer (including breast cancer), vaginal bleeding that has not been checked by a doctor, or had a blood clot (including heart attack or stroke).</font></p><p><b><font size="4">How to Use This Medicine:</font></b>
<br>
<b><font size="3">Patch</font></b></p><ul>
<li>
<font size="3">Your doctor will tell you how many patches to use, where to apply them, and how often to apply them. Do not use more patches or apply them more often than your doctor tells you to. </font>
</li>
<li>
<font size="3">Wash your hands with soap and water before and after applying a patch. </font>
</li>
<li>
<font size="3">Leave the patch in its sealed wrapper until you are ready to put it on. Tear the wrapper open carefully. NEVER CUT the wrapper or the patch with scissors. Do not use any patch that has been cut by accident. </font>
</li>
<li>
<font size="3">The patient instructions will show the body areas where you can wear the patch. When putting on each new patch, choose a different place within these areas. Do not put the new patch on the same place you wore the last one. Be sure to remove the old patch before applying a new one. </font>
</li>
<li>
<font size="3">Do not use oil, lotion, or powder on the skin where you place the patch. Do not put the patch over burns, cuts, or irritated skin. </font>
</li>
<li>
<font size="3">You may take a bath, shower, or swim while wearing a patch. Do not expose the patch to the sun for long periods of time.</font>
</li>
<li>
<font size="3">If a patch falls off, put it back on. If the patch does not stick completely, put on a new patch, but continue to follow your original schedule for changing to a new one.</font>
</li>
<li>
<font size="3">Fold the used patch in half with the sticky side together. Throw it in the trash, out of the reach of children and pets. Do not flush the patch down the toilet.</font>
</li>
<li>
<font size="3"><b>Missed dose: </b>If you forget to wear or change a patch, put one on as soon as you can. If it is almost time to put on your next patch, wait until then to apply a new patch and skip the one you missed.  Do not apply extra patches to make up for a missed dose.  Never wear 2 patches at the same time.</font>
</li>
