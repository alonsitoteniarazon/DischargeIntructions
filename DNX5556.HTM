<body>         <p><b><font size="4">Methylphenidate (Absorbed through the skin)</font></b>
<br>
<b><font size="3">Methylphenidate (meth-il-FEN-i-date)</font></b></p><p>
<b><font size="3">Treats attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). </font></b>
</p><p><b><font size="4">             Brand Name(s):             </font></b><b>Daytrana</b>
<br>
<font size="3">There may be other brand names for this medicine.</font></p><p><b><font size="4">When This Medicine Should Not Be Used:</font></b>
<br>
<font size="3">This medicine is not right for everyone. Do not use it if you had an allergic reaction to methylphenidate, or if you have glaucoma, muscle tics, or a history of Tourette syndrome.</font></p><p><b><font size="4">How to Use This Medicine:</font></b>
<br>
<b><font size="3">Patch</font></b></p><ul>
<li>
<font size="3">Your doctor will tell you how many patches to use, where to apply them, and how often to apply them. Do not use more patches or apply them more often than your doctor tells you to. </font>
</li>
<li>
<font size="3">This medicine should come with a Medication Guide. Ask your pharmacist for a copy if you do not have one. </font>
</li>
<li>
<font size="3">The patch is usually placed on your hip. When you put on a new patch, do not put it on the same place you wore the last one.</font>
</li>
<li>
<font size="3">Open the medicine pouch carefully. Do not cut or tear the patch itself. Do not use a patch that is cut or torn.</font>
</li>
<li>
<font size="3">Do not touch the sticky side, because you will get medicine on your skin.</font>
</li>
<li>
<font size="3">Wash your hands with soap and water before and after applying a patch. </font>
</li>
<li>
<font size="3">Do not put the patch over burns, cuts, or irritated skin.  Make sure the skin area is clean, dry, cool, and free of powder, oil, or lotion before you apply the patch. Press down on the patch for 30 seconds to make sure it sticks.</font>
</li>
<li>
<font size="3">If a patch comes off, put on a new one in a different spot on the same hip. Remove the new patch at the same time that you would have removed the old one.</font>
</li>
<li>
<font size="3">Never wear 2 patches at the same time.</font>
</li>
<li>
<font size="3">Do not wear patches for longer than 9 hours a day total. If you put on a new patch because one fell off, the total time for both patches should still be less than 9 hours. Use the chart that comes with the patient instructions to help you keep track of how long to wear the patch. Take the patch off by slowly peeling it back. Use mineral oil or petroleum jelly if needed to make the patch less sticky.</font>
</li>
<li>
<font size="3">The patch might come off if you go swimming or take a bath or shower.</font>
</li>
<li>
<font size="3"><b>Missed dose: </b> If you forget to apply the patch at the usual time, you may apply it later in the day. Remove it at the time you normally would, so you do not have side effects later than usual (such as trouble sleeping that night).</font>
</li>
<li>
<font size="3">Store the patches at room temperature in a closed container, away from heat, moisture, and direct light.  Do not store in the refrigerator or freezer.</font>
</li>
<li>
<font size="3">Ask your pharmacist about the best way to dispose of used or leftover patches. Fold used or leftover patches in half with the sticky sides together. Then wash your hands with soap and water. When you stop treatment or the patches expire, take each patch out of its pouch, fold it in half, and dispose as directed.</font>
</li>
<li>
<font size="3">There is still enough medicine in a used patch to make a child or pet sick, so be sure they cannot come in contact with the patches. </font>
</li>
