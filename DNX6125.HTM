<b><font size="3">Treats diabetes.</font></b>
</p><p><b><font size="4">             Brand Name(s):             </font></b><b>Tresiba</b>
<br>
<font size="3">There may be other brand names for this medicine.</font></p><p><b><font size="4">When This Medicine Should Not Be Used:</font></b>
<br>
<font size="3">This medicine is not right for everyone. Do not use it if you had an allergic reaction to insulin degludec.</font></p><p><b><font size="4">How to Use This Medicine:</font></b>
<br>
<b><font size="3">Injectable</font></b></p><ul>
<li>
<font size="3">Your healthcare provider will work with you to personalize your dose and treatment based on your insulin needs and lifestyle. You will be taught how to give yourself the injections. Make sure you understand all instructions. Ask the doctor, nurse, or pharmacist if you have questions.</font>
</li>
<li>
<font size="3">Always double-check both the concentration (strength) of your insulin and your dose. Concentration and dose are not the same. The dose is how many units of insulin you will use. The concentration tells how many units of insulin are in each milliliter (mL), such as 100 units/mL (U-100), but this does not mean you will use 100 units at a time.</font>
</li>
<li>
<font size="3">Read and follow the patient instructions that come with this medicine. Talk to your doctor or pharmacist if you have any questions. </font>
</li>
<li>
<font size="3">If you use insulin once a day, it is best to use it at about the same time every day.</font>
</li>
<li>
<font size="3">The medicine should look clear. Do not use it if it is cloudy or discolored. Do not mix this medicine with any other insulin or with water.</font>
</li>
<li>
<font size="3">You will be shown the body areas where this shot can be given. Use a different body area each time you give yourself a shot. Keep track of where you give each shot to make sure you rotate body areas. </font>
</li>
<li>
<font size="3">Use a new needle and syringe each time you inject your medicine. </font>
</li>
<li>
<font size="3">Always check the label before use, to make sure you have the correct type of insulin. Do not change the brand, type, or concentration unless your doctor tells you to.</font>
</li>
<li>
<font size="3"><b>Missed dose: </b>Take a dose as soon as you remember. If it is almost time for your next dose, skip the missed dose and take your next dose at the regular time.
