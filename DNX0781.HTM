<b><font size="3">Tablet</font></b></p><ul>
<li>
<font size="3">Your doctor will tell you how much of this medicine to use and how often.</font>
</li>
<li>
<font size="3">Take the tablet at the start (with the first bite) of your main meals.</font>
</li>
</ul>
<p>
<b><font size="3">If a dose is missed:</font></b>
</p>
<ul>
<li>
<font size="3">If you remember the dose while you are still eating or right after you finished your meal, take the dose right away. Otherwise, wait until your next main meal to use your medicine.</font>
</li>
<li>
<font size="3">You should not use two doses at the same time.</font>
</li>
</ul>
<p>
<b><font size="4">How to Store and Dispose of This Medicine:</font></b>
</p>
<ul>
<li>
<font size="3">Store the tablets at room temperature away from heat, moisture, and direct light. Keep the medicine bottle closed tightly.</font>
</li>
<li>
<font size="3">Keep all medicine out of the reach of children.</font>
</li>
</ul><p><b><font size="4">Drugs and Foods to Avoid:</font></b>
<br>
<b><font size="3">Ask your doctor or pharmacist before using any other medicine, including over-the-counter medicines, vitamins, and herbal products.</font></b></p><ul>
<li>
<font size="3">Certain drugs can increase the level of sugar in your blood and make it harder for you to control your diabetes. Some of these drugs are diuretics (water pills such as Lasix&#174; or Dyazide&#174;), steroids (such as Prednisone&#174;), Dilantin&#174;, estrogen, birth control pills, niacin, and some cold and allergy drugs. Make sure your doctor knows if you are using any of these drugs.</font>
</li>
<li>
<font size="3">Medicines used to help digest food (such as Donnazyme&#174;, Pancrease&#174;, or Creon&#174;) should not be taken at the same time as miglitol.</font>
</li>
<li>
<font size="3">Make sure your doctor knows if you are using any other medicines, especially those for your heart, stomach, blood pressure, or to treat your diabetes.</font>
</li>
</ul>
<p>
<b><font size="4">Warnings While Using This Medicine:</font></b>
</p>
<ul>
<li>
<font size="3">Talk to your doctor before using this medicine if you are pregnant or breastfeeding.</font>
</li>
<li>
<font size="3">Tell your doctor if you have kidney disease or any problems with digestion or your bowels.</font>
</li>
<li>
<font size="3">Because of the way miglitol works, it is likely to cause gas. This is normal and should get better over time.</font>
</li>
<li>
<font size="3">To keep your diabetes under control, follow the diet that your doctor ordered, exercise regularly, and test your urine or blood for sugar as your doctor ordered.</font>
</li>
<li>
<font size="3">Miglitol by itself does not cause low blood sugar the way some other medicines to treat diabetes can. But, if you also use other anti-diabetes medicine, miglitol can work with these other medicines to make your blood sugar even lower.</font>
</li>
<li>
<font size="3">If your blood sugar gets too low, you may feel weak, drowsy, confused, or very hungry. You may also sweat, shake, or have blurred vision, a fast heartbeat, trouble concentrating, or a headache that won't go away.</font>
</li>
<li>
<font size="3">Make sure you know what to do if your blood sugar gets too low. Teach your friends, co-workers, or family members what they can do to help you if you have low blood sugar.</font>
</li>
<li>
<font size="3">You may need to keep a supply of glucose tablets or gel with you to treat low blood sugar. Regular table sugar may not work as well for low blood sugar, because miglitol keeps your body from absorbing regular sugar quickly.</font>
</li>
<li>
<font size="3">Tell your doctor if you start to have more problems than usual with low blood sugar.</font>
</li>
</ul><p><b><font size="4">Possible Side Effects While Using This Medicine:</font></b>
<br>
<b><font size="3">Call your doctor right away if you notice any of these side effects:</font></b></p><ul>
<li>
<font size="3">Gas, diarrhea, or stomach discomfort</font>
</li>
</ul><p><b><font size="4">If you notice other side effects that you think are caused by this medicine, tell your doctor.</font></b>
<br>
<b><font size="3">Call your doctor for medical advice about side effects.   You may report side effects to FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088</font></b></p><p></p>
