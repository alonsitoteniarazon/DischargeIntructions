<b><font size="3">Sumatriptan Succinate (soo-ma-TRIP-tan SUX-i-nate)</font></b></p><p>
<b><font size="3">Treats migraines.</font></b>
</p><p><b><font size="4">             Brand Name(s):             </font></b><b>Zecuity</b>
<br>
<font size="3">There may be other brand names for this medicine.</font></p><p><b><font size="4">When This Medicine Should Not Be Used:</font></b>
<br>
<font size="3">This medicine is not right for everyone. Do not use it if you had an allergic reaction to sumatriptan. Tell your doctor if you have heart disease or blood circulation problems, including heart rhythm problems, ischemic bowel disease, or a history of heart disease, heart attack, angina, stroke, or transient ischemic attack (TIA).</font></p><p><b><font size="4">How to Use This Medicine:</font></b>
<br>
<b><font size="3">Device Assisted Patch</font></b></p><ul>
<li>
<font size="3">Your doctor will tell you how many patches to use, where to apply them, and how often to apply them. Do not use more patches or apply them more often than your doctor tells you to. </font>
</li>
<li>
<font size="3">This medicine is contained in a skin patch. The patch uses electricity to deliver the medicine through your skin.</font>
</li>
<li>
<font size="3">The patches come in sealed pouches. Do not use this medicine if the pouch seal is broken or if the patch is cut, damaged, or changed in any way.</font>
</li>
<li>
<font size="3">Choose a skin area for the patch. The patch should be applied clean, dry skin on your upper arm or thigh. Choose a place that does not have much hair and does not have a scar, tattoo, cut, burn, scratch, or other irritation. The patch should not be placed on skin that has been red or irritated in the past 3 days.</font>
</li>
<li>
<font size="3">Wash your hands with soap and water before and after applying a patch. </font>
</li>
<li>
<font size="3">When you are ready to apply the patch, pull the 2 foil tabs. Rub each foil packet. Trace around the green arrow 3 times.</font>
</li>
<li>
<font size="3">Unfold the orange flap. Lift open the package. Slowly peel the patch from the silver liner. Make sure the medicine pads are securely attached.</font>
</li>
<li>
<font size="3">Apply the patch to your skin. Push the activation button. A red LED (light emitting diode) should turn on. The red light should blink and then turn solid red.</font>
</li>
<li>
<font size="3">If the light does not stay solid red or turns off in the first 10 minutes, that means the patch is not working. Take the patch off and dispose of it. Start over with a new patch.</font>
</li>
<li>
<font size="3">You might feel a little burning or tingling when the patch first starts working.</font>
</li>
<li>
<font size="3">The patch must be applied and activated within 15 minutes after you remove the foil tabs.</font>
</li>
<li>
<font size="3">You can tape the patch to your skin with medical tape if it starts to peel off.</font>
</li>
<li>
<font size="3">Wear the patch for 4 hours or until the light turns off. Remove the patch slowly to avoid skin irritation. Clean the area gently with a mild soap and water to remove any medicine left on the skin.</font>
</li>
<li>
<font size="3">Keep the patch dry. Do not bathe, shower, or swim while you are wearing a patch.</font>
</li>
<li>
<font size="3">Remove the patch and call your doctor right away if you feel moderate to severe pain at the patch site. This is to avoid serious burns and possible scars at the patch site.</font>
</li>
<li>
<font size="3">If your headache comes back or gets worse, you may apply a second patch to your other arm or thigh. However, you must wait <b>at least 2 hours </b>after the first patch was activated.</font>
</li>
<li>
<font size="3">Do not use more than 2 patches within 24 hours.</font>
</li>
<li>
<font size="3">Read and follow the patient instructions that come with this medicine. Talk to your doctor or pharmacist if you have any questions. </font>
</li>
<li>
<font size="3">Store the patches at room temperature in a closed container, away from heat, moisture, and direct light. </font>
</li>
<li>
<font size="3">Fold the used patch in half with the sticky sides together.  Throw any used patch away so that children or pets cannot get to it. You will also need to throw away old patches after the expiration date has passed.  This patch contains lithium-manganese dioxide batteries. Talk to your doctor or pharmacist about how to follow state and local laws when you throw away the patch.</font>
</li>
