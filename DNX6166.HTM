<br>
<b><font size="3">Aerosol</font></b></p><ul>
<li>
<font size="3">You will use this medicine with a device called a metered-dose inhaler. The inhaler fits on the medicine canister and turns the medicine into a fine spray that you breathe in through your mouth and to your lungs. You may be told to use a spacer, which is a tube that is placed between the inhaler and your mouth. Your caregiver will show you how to use your inhaler and the spacer (if needed). Use this medicine at the same time every day. Do not use more medicine or use it more often than instructed.</font>
</li>
<li>
<font size="3">This medicine should come with a Medication Guide. Ask your pharmacist for a copy if you do not have one. </font>
</li>
<li>
<font size="3">You will need to prime the inhaler before you use it for the first time. To do this, shake the inhaler and spray the medicine into the air away from your face. Do this 4 times. You will need to re-prime the inhaler after each cleaning and if you have not used it for 7 days or longer. Re-prime the inhaler by shaking and spraying it into the air away from your face 2 times.</font>
</li>
<li>
<font size="3">If you are supposed to use more than one puff, wait 1 to 2 minutes before inhaling the second puff. Repeat these steps for the next puff, starting with shaking the inhaler. </font>
</li>
<li>
<font size="3">Clean the inhaler once a week. Remove the canister and rinse the actuator in warm water for about 30 seconds. Turn the actuator upside down and rinse again for about 30 seconds. Let the actuator air dry overnight.</font>
