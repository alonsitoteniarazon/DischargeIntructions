<br>
<font size="3">You should not receive this medicine if you have had an allergic reaction to anti-inhibitor coagulant complex, if your blood clots normally, if you have bleeding problems caused by coagulation factor VIII or coagulation factor IX deficiencies, or a blood clotting problem called disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC).</font></p><p><b><font size="4">How to Use This Medicine:</font></b>
<br>
<b><font size="3">Injectable</font></b></p><ul>

<font size="3">The medicine must be given by someone trained to give an IV, such as a nurse. You, someone in your family, or a friend can also be taught to give the medicine.</font>

</li>
<li>
