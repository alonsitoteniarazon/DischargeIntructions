<b><font size="3">Fentanyl Citrate (FEN-ta-nil SIT-rate)</font></b></p><p>
<b><font size="3">Treats cancer pain in patients whose pain is not always relieved by other pain medicines. This medicine is a narcotic pain reliever.</font></b>
</p><p><b><font size="4">             Brand Name(s):             </font></b><b>Lazanda</b>
<br>
<font size="3">There may be other brand names for this medicine.</font></p><p><b><font size="4">When This Medicine Should Not Be Used:</font></b>
<br>
<font size="3">This medicine is not right for everyone. Do not use it if you had an allergic reaction to fentanyl, if you are not taking pain medicine for around-the-clock pain control, or have severe lung or breathing problems (including severe asthma) or stomach blockage (including paralytic ileus).</font></p><p><b><font size="4">How to Use This Medicine:</font></b>
<br>
<b><font size="3">Spray</font></b></p><ul>
<li>
<font size="3">Take your medicine as directed. Your dose may need to be changed several times to find what works best for you. <b>An overdose can be dangerous. Follow directions carefully so you do not get too much medicine at one time.</b></font>
</li>
<li>
<font size="3">This medicine is for use only in the nose. Do not get any of it in your eyes or on your skin. If it does get on these areas, rinse it off right away. </font>
</li>
<li>
<font size="3"><b>To use: </b>
<br>
<ul>
<li>
<font size="3">Keep the spray in the child-resistant container until ready to use.</font>
</li>
<li>
<font size="3">If you are using the nasal spray for the first time, you will need to prime the spray. To do this, you should release four sprays into the pouch. Now it is ready to use.</font>
</li>
<li>
<font size="3">If you have not used the medicine for more than 5 days, re-prime by spraying once into the pouch.</font>
</li>
<li>
<font size="3">Before using this medicine, gently blow your nose to clear the nostrils.</font>
</li>
<li>
<font size="3">Insert the tip of the bottle into the nose. Point towards the bridge of the nose and tilt the bottle slightly.</font>
</li>
<li>
<font size="3">Press down firmly on the finger grips until you hear a "click" sound and the number in the dose counter window adds up. This confirms a spray has been taken.</font>
</li>
<li>
<font size="3">Return the spray bottle to the child-resistant container after each use.</font>
</li>
</ul>
</font>
</li>
<li>
<font size="3">After using the nasal spray, wipe the tip of the bottle with a clean tissue and put the cap back on. </font>
</li>
<li>
<font size="3">This medicine should come with a Medication Guide. Ask your pharmacist for a copy if you do not have one. </font>
</li>
<li>
<font size="3"><b>Missed dose: </b>Take a dose as soon as you remember. If it is almost time for your next dose, wait until then and take a regular dose. Do not take extra medicine to make up for a missed dose. </font>
</li>
<li>
<font size="3">Store the medicine in a closed container at room temperature, away from heat, moisture, and direct light. </font>
</li>
<li>
<font size="3"><b>Disposal: </b>Ask your pharmacist about the best way to dispose of medicine that you do not use. Throw away any spray bottle and start using a new one if you have used 8 sprays or if it has been 60 days or more since it has been used. Dispose any used, partially used, or unneeded spray bottles by emptying and spraying the remaining solution into the pouch. The sealed pouch and the empty bottle should be placed in a child-resistant container before discarding it in the trash can. Wash your hands with soap and water right away after handling the pouch.</font>
</li>
</ul><p><b><font size="4">Drugs and Foods to Avoid:</font></b>
