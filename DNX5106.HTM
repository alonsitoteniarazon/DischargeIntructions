<body>         <p><b><font size="4">Levonorgestrel (Into the uterus)</font></b>
<br>
<b><font size="3">Levonorgestrel (lee-voe-nor-JES-trel)</font></b></p><p>
<b><font size="3">Prevents pregnancy and treats heavy menstrual bleeding. This is an intrauterine device (IUD), which is a reversible form of birth control. This IUD slowly releases levonorgestrel, a hormone.</font></b>
</p><p><b><font size="4">             Brand Name(s):             </font></b><b>Kyleena</b><b>, Liletta</b><b>, Mirena</b><b>, Skyla</b>
<br>
<font size="3">There may be other brand names for this medicine.</font></p><p><b><font size="4">When This Medicine Should Not Be Used:</font></b>
<br>
<font size="3">This device is not right for everyone. Do not use it if you had an allergic reaction to levonorgestrel, or if you are pregnant.</font></p><p><b><font size="4">How to Use This Medicine:</font></b>
<br>
<b><font size="3">Device</font></b></p><ul>
<li>
<font size="3">A nurse or other trained health professional will give you this medicine. </font>
</li>
<li>
<font size="3">The IUD is usually inserted by your doctor during your monthly period. You will need to see your doctor 4 to 6 weeks after the IUD is placed and then once a year.</font>
</li>
<li>
<font size="3">Your IUD has a string or "tail" that is made of plastic thread. About one or two inches of this string hangs into your vagina. You cannot see this string, and it will not cause problems when you have sex. Check your IUD after each monthly period. You may not be protected against pregnancy if you cannot feel the string or if you feel plastic. Do the following to check the placement of your IUD:<br>
<ul>
<li>
<font size="3">Wash your hands with soap and warm water. Dry them with a clean towel.</font>
</li>
<li>
<font size="3">Bend your knees and squat low to the ground.</font>
</li>
<li>
<font size="3">Gently put your index finger high inside your vagina. The cervix is at the top of the vagina. Find the IUD string coming from your cervix. Never pull on the string. You should <b>not</b> be able to feel the plastic of the IUD itself. Wash your hands after you are done checking your IUD string.</font>
</li>
</ul>
</font>
</li>
<li>
<font size="3">Your doctor will need to remove your IUD after 3 years for Skyla&#153;, after 4 years for Liletta&#174;, or after 5 years for Kyleena&#153; or Mirena&#174;. You will also need to have it replaced if it comes out of your uterus. If you are using Mirena&#174; or Liletta&#174; and want to stop, your doctor can remove it at any time. However, you may become pregnant as soon as Mirena&#174; is removed or if you have intercourse the week before Liletta&#174; is removed. Use another form of birth control or have a new IUD inserted to keep from getting pregnant.</font>
</li>
</ul><p><b><font size="4">Drugs and Foods to Avoid:</font></b>
<br>
<b><font size="3">Ask your doctor or pharmacist before using any other medicine, including over-the-counter medicines, vitamins, and herbal products.</font></b></p><ul>
<li>
<font size="3">Some medicines can affect how this device works. Tell your doctor if you are using a blood thinner (including warfarin).</font>
</li>
</ul>
<p>
<b><font size="4">Warnings While Using This Medicine:</font></b>
</p>
<ul>
<li>
<font size="3">Tell your doctor if you are breastfeeding, or if you had a baby, miscarriage, or abortion in the past 3 months. Tell your doctor if you have liver disease (including tumor or cancer), heart disease, breast cancer, heart or blood circulation problems, migraine, high blood pressure, or a history of heart valve problems, blood clotting problems, stroke, or heart attack. Tell your doctor if you have problems with your immune system or have had surgery on your female organs (especially fallopian tubes).</font>
</li>
<li>
<font size="3">Tell your doctor if you have had any problems, infections, or other conditions that affected your reproductive system. There are many problems that could make an IUD a bad choice for you, including if you have fibroids, unexplained bleeding, a uterus that has an unusual shape, a recent infection, a history of pelvic inflammatory disease, an abnormal Pap test, ectopic pregnancy, cancer or suspected cancer, or an existing IUD.</font>
</li>
<li>
<font size="3">There is a small chance that you could get pregnant when using an IUD, just as there is with any birth control. If you get pregnant, your doctor may remove your IUD to lower the risk of miscarriage or other problems.</font>
</li>
<li>
<font size="3">This medicine may cause the following problems:<br>
<ul>
<li>
<font size="3">Increased risk of ectopic pregnancy (pregnancy outside the uterus)</font>
</li>
<li>
<font size="3">Increased risk of serious infections, including sepsis</font>
</li>
<li>
<font size="3">Increased risk of pelvic inflammatory disease (PID) or endometritis</font>
</li>
<li>
<font size="3">Perforation (hole in the wall of your uterus), which can damage other organs</font>
</li>
<li>
<font size="3">Increased risk for ovarian cysts</font>
</li>
<li>
<font size="3">Increased risk of breast cancer</font>
</li>
<li>
<font size="3">Increased risk of high blood pressure, stroke, heart attack, or clotting problems</font>
</li>
</ul>
</font>
</li>
<li>
<font size="3">You might have some spotting and cramping during the first weeks after the IUD has been inserted. These symptoms should decrease or go away within a few weeks up to 6 months.</font>
</li>
<li>
<font size="3">You could have less bleeding or even stop having periods by the end of the first year. Call your doctor if you have a change from your regular bleeding pattern after you have had your IUD for awhile, such as more bleeding or if you miss a period (and you were having periods even with your IUD).</font>
</li>
<li>
<font size="3">An IUD can slip partly or all the way out of your uterus. If this happens, use condoms or another form of birth control, and call your doctor right away.</font>
</li>
<li>
<font size="3">This IUD will not protect you from HIV/AIDS or other sexually transmitted diseases.</font>
</li>
<li>
<font size="3">If you have the Skyla&#153; or Kyleena&#153;, tell your healthcare provider before you have an MRI test.</font>
</li>
<li>
<font size="3">Your doctor will check your progress and the effects of this medicine at regular visits. Keep all appointments. </font>
</li>
