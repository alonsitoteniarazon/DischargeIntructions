</li>
<li>
<font size="3">Your doctor may give you medicines to use before the aztreonam inhalation liquid. Carefully follow your doctor's instructions about how to use your medicines. Aztreonam inhalation will work better if you use all of your medicines in the right order.</font>

</li>
<li>
<font size="3">You will use this medicine with an inhaler device called a nebulizer. The nebulizer turns the medicine into a fine mist that you breathe in through your mouth and to your lungs.

<li>
<font size="3">Use the nebulizer for 2 to 3 minutes, or until the liquid in the nebulizer cup is gone.</font>
