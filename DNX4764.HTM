<b><font size="3">Ciprofloxacin Hydrochloride (sip-roe-FLOX-a-sin hye-droe-KLOR-ide), Dexamethasone (dex-a-METH-a-sone)</font></b></p><p>
<b><font size="3">Treats ear infections caused by bacteria. This medicine contains a quinolone antibiotic and a corticosteroid. </font></b>

<br>
<font size="3">There may be other brand names for this medicine.</font></p><p><b><font size="4">When This Medicine Should Not Be Used:</font></b>
<br>
<font size="3">This medicine is not right for everyone. Do not use it if you had an allergic reaction to ciprofloxacin, dexamethasone, or similar medicines, or if you have an ear infection caused by a fungus or virus (including herpes simplex).</font></p><p><b><font size="4">How to Use This Medicine:</font></b>
<br>
<b><font size="3">Liquid, Drop</font></b></p><ul>
<li>
<font size="3">Your doctor will tell you how much medicine to use. Do not use more than directed. </font>
</li>
<li>
<font size="3">Use this medicine only in your ear. </font>
</li>
<li>
<font size="3">You may warm the drops by holding the unopened bottle in your hands for a few minutes.  Cold drops might make you dizzy.</font>
</li>
<li>
<font size="3">Shake the medicine well just before you use it. </font>
</li>
<li>
<font size="3">Remove the cap. Do not let the tip of the dropper touch anything, including your ear. </font>
</li>
<li>
<font size="3">Lie down or tilt your head to the side. For a child, gently pull the child's earlobe down and back to straighten the child's ear canal. For an adult, gently pull the earlobe up and back to straighten the ear canal. </font>

<li>
<font size="3">Drop the prescribed number of drops into the ear. Keep the ear tilted up for a few minutes or put a cotton ball into your ear. </font>
</li>
<li>
<font size="3"><b>Middle ear infection:</b> Gently fold in the flap of skin at the front of the ear after you put in the drops. Let go of the flap, then fold it in again. Do this 5 times with a pumping motion. This helps move the medicine through the tube and into the middle ear.</font>
