<br>
<b><font size="3">Injectable</font></b></p><ul>
<li>
<font size="3">Your doctor will prescribe your exact dose and tell you how often it should be given. This medicine is given as a shot under your skin. </font>
</li>
<li>
<font size="3">A nurse or other health provider will give you this medicine. </font>
</li>
<li>
<font size="3">You may be taught how to give your medicine at home. Make sure you understand all instructions before giving yourself an injection. Do not use more medicine or use it more often than your doctor tells you to. </font>
</li>
<li>
<font size="3">Read and follow the patient instructions that come with this medicine. Talk to your doctor or pharmacist if you have any questions. </font>
</li>
<li>
<font size="3">You will be shown the body areas where this shot can be given. Use a different body area each time you give yourself a shot. Keep track of where you give each shot to make sure you rotate body areas.  This injection is usually given in the upper arm, upper leg, or stomach. Do not inject it near your elbow, knee, groin, lower or inner buttocks, or into your navel (belly button) or any skin where you have a mole, scar, bruise, tattoo, or burn. </font>
</li>
<li>
<font size="3">Use a new needle, syringe, and vial of medicine each time you inject your medicine.</font>
</li>
<li>
<font size="3">This medicine comes as a powder that must be mixed with sterile water. Use <b>only</b> the sterile water that came with your medicine to prepare the mixture. </font>
</li>
<li>
<font size="3">Do <b>not</b> shake the medicine after you add the water. Gently tap the vial for 10 seconds and then roll it between your hands to mix. </font>
</li>
<li>
<font size="3">Wait until the powder has completely dissolved before you inject it. The mixture should be clear and colorless and should not have any bubbles in it. This may take up to 45 minutes. </font>
</li>
<li>
<font size="3"><b>Missed dose: </b>Take a dose as soon as you remember. If it is almost time for your next dose, wait until then and take a regular dose. Do not take extra medicine to make up for a missed dose. </font>
</li>
<li>
<font size="3">Store the powdered medicine at room temperature, away from heat, moisture, and direct light. After you mix the powder with the sterile water, you may use the mixture right away or store it in the refrigerator for up to 24 hours. Do not store the mixture in the syringe. If you use a mixture that has been in the refrigerator, let it slowly return to room temperature before you inject it.</font>
