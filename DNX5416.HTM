<br>
<font size="3">You should not receive this medicine if you have had an allergic reaction to tenecteplase. Because this medicine increases the risk of bleeding problems, some medical conditions may make receiving tenecteplase dangerous. These include any type of bleeding in your body, such as a bleeding ulcer or having had a recent surgery or injury (within the past 6 to 8 weeks). Other medical conditions that may make it unsafe to receive this medicine include a brain tumor, a history of strokes, certain blood vessel problems, or uncontrolled high blood pressure. Since this medicine may save your life, your doctor will weigh the benefits of this medicine against the risks of giving it if you have certain medical problems.</font></p><p><b><font size="4">How to Use This Medicine:</font></b>
<br>
<b><font size="3">Injectable, Kit</font></b></p><ul>
<li>
<font size="3">A nurse or other health provider will give you this medicine. This medicine is given through a needle placed in one of your veins.</font>
</li>
<li>
<font size="3">You may also receive blood thinning medicines, such as aspirin and heparin, with tenecteplase. Tenecteplase breaks apart blood clots you already have, while other blood thinning medicines help prevent more clots from forming. During this time, you will be watched closely to make sure the medicine is working and is not causing unwanted side effects.</font>
