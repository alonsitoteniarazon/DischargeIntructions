<br>
<b><font size="3">Implant</font></b></p><ul>
<li>
<font size="3">This medicine is a set of 2 hormone-releasing birth control implants that is surgically placed and removed under the skin of the upper arm by a trained healthcare provider. The implants are placed in the upper arm for up to 5 years.</font>
</li>
<li>
<font size="3">The implants are usually inserted by your doctor within the first 7 days of your regular menstrual period. Your doctor also needs to do a pregnancy test before inserting the implants.</font>
</li>
<li>
<font size="3">After the implants are inserted, your doctor should feel your arm to check that the implants are in the right place. If you cannot feel the implants in your arm, you will need to use a non-hormonal birth control (such as condoms, spermicide) until your doctor confirms that the implants are in place.</font>
</li>
<li>
<font size="3">Your doctor will cover the insertion site with a gauze bandage. Keep it dry and avoid heavy lifting for 2 to 3 days. The gauze may be removed after 1 to 3 days.</font>
