<br>
<font size="3">There may be other brand names for this medicine.</font></p><p><b><font size="4">When This Medicine Should Not Be Used:</font></b>
<br>
<font size="3">This medicine is not right for everyone. Do not use it if you had an allergic reaction to insulin glulisine.</font></p><p><b><font size="4">How to Use This Medicine:</font></b>
<br>
<b><font size="3">Injectable</font></b></p><ul>
<li>
<font size="3">Your healthcare provider will work with you to personalize your dose and treatment based on your insulin needs and lifestyle. You will be taught how to give yourself the injections or use your insulin pump. Make sure you understand all instructions. Ask the doctor, nurse, or pharmacist if you have questions. </font>
</li>
<li>
<font size="3">Always double-check both the concentration (strength) of your insulin and your dose. Concentration and dose are not the same. The dose is how many units of insulin you will use. The concentration tells how many units of insulin are in each milliliter (mL), such as 100 units/mL (U-100), but this does not mean you will use 100 units at a time.</font>
</li>
<li>
<font size="3">Read and follow the patient instructions that come with this medicine. Talk to your doctor or pharmacist if you have any questions. </font>
</li>
<li>
<font size="3">You will be shown the body areas where this shot can be given. Use a different body area each time you give yourself a shot. Keep track of where you give each shot to make sure you rotate body areas. </font>
</li>
<li>
<font size="3">Use a new needle and syringe each time you inject your medicine. If you use a syringe, use only the kind that is made for insulin injections. Some insulin must be given with a specific type of syringe or needle. Ask your pharmacist if you are not sure which one to use.</font>
</li>
<li>
<font size="3">Check the label before use. Do not change the brand, type, or concentration unless your doctor tells you to. If you use a pump or other device, make sure the insulin is made for that device.</font>
