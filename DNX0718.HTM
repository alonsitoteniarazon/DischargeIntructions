<br>
<b><font size="3">Ganciclovir (gan-SYE-kloe-vir)</font></b></p><p>
<b><font size="3">Treats eye infections caused by cytomegalovirus (CMV).</font></b>
</p><p><b><font size="4">             Brand Name(s):             </font></b>
<br>
<font size="3">There may be other brand names for this medicine.</font></p><p><b><font size="4">When This Medicine Should Not Be Used:</font></b>
<br>
<font size="3">You should not use this medicine if you have had an allergic reaction to ganciclovir, acyclovir (Zovirax&#174;), famciclovir (Famvir&#174;), or valacyclovir (Valtrex&#174;). These implants should not be used if you have a very low platelet count in your blood or a different kind of eye infection other than a CMV eye infection.</font></p><p><b><font size="4">How to Use This Medicine:</font></b>
<br>
<b><font size="3">Implant</font></b></p><ul>
<li>
<font size="3">You will have surgery so that the doctor can place the eye implant into your eye. The implant will slowly release medicine into your eye over the next 5 to 8 months.</font>
</li>
</ul><p><b><font size="4">Drugs and Foods to Avoid:</font></b>
<br>
<b><font size="3">Ask your doctor or pharmacist before using any other medicine, including over-the-counter medicines, vitamins, and herbal products.</font></b></p><ul>
<li>
<font size="3">You should not use eye drops or put any other medicines in your eyes unless you talk to your doctor first.</font>
</li>
</ul>
<p>
<b><font size="4">Warnings While Using This Medicine:</font></b>
</p>
<ul>
<li>
<font size="3">Problems that may occur during your eye surgery include eye infection, detached retina, or development of cataracts. If you have questions about these or any other risks from having the implants, talk with your doctor.</font>
</li>
<li>
<font size="3">You may not be able to see as clearly for about 2 to 4 weeks after the implant is put in. This is expected after your eye surgery. If your vision does not get better, tell your doctor.</font>
</li>
<li>
<font size="3">Ganciclovir eye implants will not cure CMV eye infections, but may slow progress of the disease.</font>
</li>
<li>
<font size="3">This medicine only works on CMV infection in your eyes. It does not treat CMV infections in other areas of your body.</font>
</li>
<li>
<font size="3">It is important for you to have your eyes checked regularly after the implants are put in. Keep all of the appointments your doctor has scheduled for you.</font>
</li>
<li>
<font size="3">If you are pregnant or breastfeeding, talk with your doctor before the eye implants are put in. Ganciclovir may be harmful to an unborn baby.</font>
</li>
<li>
<font size="3">For men, ganciclovir may decrease the amount of sperm produced, so that you may not be able to have children. If you have questions about this, talk with your doctor.</font>
</li>
