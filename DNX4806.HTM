<b><font size="3">Phenelzine (FEN-el-zeen)</font></b></p><p>
<b><font size="3">Treats depression. This medicine is an MAOI. </font></b>
</p><p><b><font size="4">             Brand Name(s):             </font></b><b>Nardil</b>
<br>
<font size="3">There may be other brand names for this medicine.</font></p><p><b><font size="4">When This Medicine Should Not Be Used:</font></b>
<br>
<font size="3">This medicine is not right for everyone. Do not use it if you had an allergic reaction to phenelzine, or if you have high blood pressure, liver disease, heart failure, severe kidney disease, or pheochromocytoma (a tumor of the adrenal gland). </font></p><p><b><font size="4">How to Use This Medicine:</font></b>
<br>
<b><font size="3">Tablet</font></b></p><ul>
<li>
<font size="3">Take your medicine as directed. Your dose may need to be changed several times to find what works best for you.  You may need to use this medicine for up to 4 weeks before you start to feel better.</font>
</li>
<li>
<font size="3">This medicine should come with a Medication Guide. Ask your pharmacist for a copy if you do not have one. </font>
</li>
<li>
<font size="3"><b>Missed dose: </b>Take a dose as soon as you remember. If it is almost time for your next dose, wait until then and take a regular dose. Do not take extra medicine to make up for a missed dose. </font>
</li>
<li>
<font size="3">Store the medicine in a closed container at room temperature, away from heat, moisture, and direct light. </font>
</li>
</ul><p><b><font size="4">Drugs and Foods to Avoid:</font></b>
<br>
<b><font size="3">Ask your doctor or pharmacist before using any other medicine, including over-the-counter medicines, vitamins, and herbal products.</font></b></p><ul>
<li>
<font size="3">You <b>must</b> avoid many other medicines while you are using phenelzine. These medicines used together could cause serious health problems, including death. <b>Ask your doctor before you use any other medicine. </b>You may need to wait 1 to 5 weeks before you can use the other medicine. </font>
</li>
<li>
<font size="3">Do not use phenelzine if you have used another MAOI within the past 14 days. Do not use this medicine if you are also using meperidine, dextromethorphan, methylphenidate, dopamine, epinephrine, methyldopa, bupropion, buspirone, tryptophan, guanethidine, narcotic medicine, or medicine to treat depression (such as an SSRI or SSNRI). This is not a complete list. </font>
</li>
<li>
<font size="3">Avoid foods and drinks that are high in tyramine, because your blood pressure could get dangerously high. Your doctor should give you a complete list. In general, do not eat anything aged or fermented, such as most cheese, most alcohol, cured meat (such as salami), sauerkraut, and soy sauce. Check the expiration dates on packages. Tyramine levels get higher as food gets older or if it has not been refrigerated properly. </font>
