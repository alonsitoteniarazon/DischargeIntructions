<b><font size="3">Rotigotine (roe-TIG-oh-teen)</font></b></p><p>
<b><font size="3">Treats symptoms of Parkinson disease, such as jerky muscle movements, muscle stiffness, and slow movement. Also treats restless legs syndrome (RLS).</font></b>
</p><p><b><font size="4">             Brand Name(s):             </font></b><b>Neupro</b>
<br>
<font size="3">There may be other brand names for this medicine.</font></p><p><b><font size="4">When This Medicine Should Not Be Used:</font></b>
<br>
<font size="3">Do not use this medicine if you have had an allergic reaction to rotigotine.</font></p><p><b><font size="4">How to Use This Medicine:</font></b>
<br>
<b><font size="3">Patch</font></b></p><ul>
<li>
<font size="3">Your doctor will tell you how many patches to use, where to apply them, and how often to apply them. Do not use more patches or apply them more often than your doctor tells you to. Try to change the patch at the same time each day.</font>
</li>
<li>
<font size="3">Read and follow the patient instructions that come with this medicine. Talk to your doctor or pharmacist if you have any questions. </font>
</li>
<li>
<font size="3">Wash your hands with soap and water before and after applying a patch. </font>
</li>
<li>
<font size="3">Leave the patch in its sealed wrapper until you are ready to put it on. Tear the wrapper open carefully. NEVER CUT the wrapper or the patch with scissors. Do not use any patch that has been cut by accident.  Remove the protective liner, and put the patch on immediately after you open the package.</font>
</li>
<li>
<font size="3">The patient instructions will show the body areas where you can wear the patch. When putting on each new patch, choose a different place within these areas. Do not put the new patch on the same place you wore the last one. Be sure to remove the old patch before applying a new one. Do not put a new patch in the same place for at least 14 days.</font>
</li>
<li>
<font size="3">Apply the patch to clean, dry skin that has very little or no hair. Do not put the patch over burns, cuts, irritated, or oily skin. Avoid putting the patch on skin folds, under a waistband, or on areas where it could be rubbed by tight clothing. If you need to put the patch on a hairy area, the area should be shaved at least 3 days before you apply the patch.</font>
</li>
<li>
<font size="3">Do not put cream, lotion, ointment, oil, or powder on the skin area where the patch will be placed.</font>
</li>
<li>
<font size="3">Put on a new patch if the old one has fallen off and cannot be reapplied. </font>
</li>
<li>
<font size="3">After you remove the patch, wash the site with soap and water to remove any drug or adhesive. You may also use baby or mineral oil to remove any excess medicine.</font>
</li>
</ul>
<p>
<b><font size="3">If a dose is missed:</font></b>
</p>
<ul>
<li>
<font size="3">If you forget to wear or change a patch, put one on as soon as you can. If it is almost time to put on your next patch, wait until then to apply a new patch and skip the one you missed.  Do not apply extra patches to make up for a missed dose. </font>
</li>
<li>
<font size="3">If the patch comes off, stick it back on. You can use medical tape to keep the edges taped down, if needed. If the patch comes off and you cannot find it, put on a new patch. Continue to change patches on your regular schedule. </font>
</li>
</ul>
<p>
<b><font size="4">How to Store and Dispose of This Medicine:</font></b>
</p>
<ul>
<li>
<font size="3">Store the patches at room temperature in a closed container, away from heat, moisture, and direct light. </font>
</li>
<li>
<font size="3">Fold the used patch in half with the sticky sides together.  Throw any used patch away so that children or pets cannot get to it. You will also need to throw away old patches after the expiration date has passed. </font>
</li>
<li>
<font size="3">Keep all medicine out of the reach of children. Never share your medicine with anyone. </font>
</li>

</li>
<li>
<font size="3">This medicine may change your blood pressure or heart rate. Make sure your doctor knows if you already have high or low blood pressure. Tell your doctor if you feel faint or lightheaded, or have a fast or pounding heart beat.</font>
</li>
<li>
<font size="3">This medicine may make you dizzy, lightheaded, or drowsy, especially when you first begin to use it. Do not drive, use machines, or do anything else that could be dangerous until you know how this medicine affects you. Stand or sit up slowly if you are dizzy.</font>

<li>
<font size="3">Your doctor will need to check your skin regularly for melanoma while you are receiving this medicine.</font>
</li>
<li>
<font size="3">Remove this patch before you have a medical procedure that involves electricity, such as MRI or cardioversion, because the patch contains aluminum. Make sure any doctor who treats you knows that you have this patch.</font>
</li>
<li>
<font size="3">Heat may cause your skin to absorb too much of this medicine. Keep the patch away from heat, especially from heating pads, electric blankets, hot tubs, or direct sunlight.</font>
</li>
<li>
<font size="3">Tell your doctor if you develop redness, swelling, or itchiness from the patch that lasts longer than a few days, becomes more severe, or spreads to areas outside the application site. Also, do not expose the area to direct sunlight until it heals. Direct sunlight may cause skin discoloration.</font>
</li>
<li>
<font size="3">This medicine may worsen RLS symptoms during or after treatment.</font>
</li>
<li>
<font size="3">This medicine may cause new or worsened Parkinson disease symptoms, such as jerky muscle movements, during treatment.</font>
