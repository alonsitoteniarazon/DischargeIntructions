<br>
<b><font size="3">Budesonide (bue-DES-oh-nide), Formoterol Fumarate (for-MOE-ter-ol FUE-ma-rate)</font></b></p><p>
<b><font size="3">Treats asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). Also reduces the worsening attacks of COPD. This medicine contains a corticosteroid.</font></b>
</p><p><b><font size="4">             Brand Name(s):             </font></b><b>Symbicort 160/4.5</b><b>, Symbicort 80/4.5</b>
<br>
<font size="3">There may be other brand names for this medicine.</font></p><p><b><font size="4">When This Medicine Should Not Be Used:</font></b>
<br>
<font size="3">This medicine is not right for everyone. Do not use this medicine if you had an allergic reaction to budesonide or formoterol. Do not use this medicine if your asthma attack has already started, or if you are having a severe asthma attack or COPD flare-up.</font></p><p><b><font size="4">How to Use This Medicine:</font></b>
<br>
<b><font size="3">Liquid Under Pressure, Powder</font></b></p><ul>
<li>
<font size="3">Take your medicine as directed. Your dose may need to be changed several times to find what works best for you.  Never use more medicine than your doctor prescribed.</font>
</li>
<li>
<font size="3">This medicine should come with a Medication Guide. Ask your pharmacist for a copy if you do not have one. </font>
</li>
<li>
<font size="3">You will use this medicine with a device called a metered-dose inhaler. The inhaler fits on the medicine canister and turns the medicine into a fine spray that you breathe in through your mouth and to your lungs. You may be told to use a spacer, which is a tube that is placed between the inhaler and your mouth. Your caregiver will show you how to use your inhaler and the spacer (if needed). </font>
</li>
<li>
<font size="3">Test spray in the air before using for the first time or if the inhaler has not been used for a while.  Prime the inhaler before using it for the first time. Shake well for 5 seconds, then spray into the air, away from your face. Shake and spray a second time. It is now ready for use. If the inhaler has been dropped or has not been used for more than 7 days, prime it again before use.</font>
</li>
<li>
<font size="3">Shake the inhaler well just before each use. Avoid spraying this medicine into your eyes. </font>
</li>
<li>
<font size="3">Remove the cap and look at the mouthpiece to make sure it is clean. </font>
</li>
<li>
<font size="3">To inhale this medicine, breathe out fully, trying to get as much air out of the lungs as possible. Put the mouthpiece just in front of your mouth with the canister upright. </font>
</li>
<li>
<font size="3">Open your mouth and breathe in slowly and deeply (like yawning), and at the same time firmly press down on the top of the canister once. </font>
</li>
<li>
<font size="3">Hold your breath for about 5 to 10 seconds, and then breathe out slowly. </font>
</li>
<li>
<font size="3">If you are supposed to use more than one puff, wait 1 to 2 minutes before inhaling the second puff. Repeat these steps for the next puff, starting with shaking the inhaler. </font>
</li>
<li>
<font size="3">The dose counter at the top of the inhaler will turn yellow when the inhaler has 20 or fewer doses left. Throw the inhaler when it reaches 0, or if it has been 3 months since you last opened the foil pouch.</font>
</li>
<li>
<font size="3">When you have finished all your inhalations, rinse your mouth out with water.  Do not swallow the water after rinsing.</font>
</li>
<li>
<font size="3"><b>Missed dose: </b>Take a dose as soon as you remember. If it is almost time for your next dose, wait until then and take a regular dose. Do not take extra medicine to make up for a missed dose. </font>
</li>
<li>
<font size="3">Store the canister at room temperature, away from heat and direct light. Do not freeze. Do not keep this medicine inside a car where it could be exposed to extreme heat or cold. Do not poke holes in the canister or throw it into a fire, even if the canister is empty.  Store the inhaler with the mouthpiece down.</font>
</li>
<li>
<font size="3">Ask your pharmacist, doctor, or health caregiver about the best way to dispose of the used medicine container and any leftover medicine. You will also need to throw away old medicine after the expiration date has passed. </font>
</li>
