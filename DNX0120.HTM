<br>
<b><font size="3">Chip, Liquid</font></b></p><ul>
<li>
<font size="3">Your dentist will tell you how much of this medicine to use and how often. Do not use more medicine or use it longer or more often than your dentist tells you to.</font>
</li>
<li>
<font size="3"><b>Chip</b>: Your dentist will place the chip between your gums and teeth where the gum has a deep pocket. He will place the chip after your teeth have been thoroughly cleaned. Your dentist will check the depth of the pockets in your gums every 3 months to see if they need to be treated again.</font>
</li>
<li>
<font size="3"><b>Liquid</b>: This medicine should be used after you have brushed and flossed your teeth. Measure out 1/2 fluid ounce (15 milliliters) as marked in the cap that comes with the bottle. Swish the solution in your mouth for at least 30 seconds and then spit it out. Do not swallow it. Do not mix it with water or other fluids. Do not eat or drink right after you use this medicine. </font>

<b><font size="3">If a dose is missed:</font></b>
</p>
