<b><font size="3">Selegiline (se-LE-ji-leen)</font></b></p><p>
<b><font size="3">Treats depression. This medicine is an MAOI.</font></b>
</p><p><b><font size="4">             Brand Name(s):             </font></b><b>Emsam</b>
<br>
<font size="3">There may be other brand names for this medicine.</font></p><p><b><font size="4">When This Medicine Should Not Be Used:</font></b>
<br>
<font size="3">This medicine is not right for everyone. Do not use it if you had an allergic reaction to selegiline, or if you have pheochromocytoma (adrenal gland problem).</font></p><p><b><font size="4">How to Use This Medicine:</font></b>
<br>
<b><font size="3">Patch</font></b></p><ul>
<li>
<font size="3">Your doctor will tell you how many patches to use, where to apply them, and how often to apply them. Do not use more patches or apply them more often than your doctor tells you to.  It is usually applied to dry, intact skin of the upper back, upper chest, upper thigh, or on the outer surface of the upper arm.</font>
</li>
<li>
<font size="3">Wash your hands with soap and water before and after applying a patch.  Wash the area of skin where you will apply the patch gently with soap and warm water. Rinse completely and dry with a clean towel.</font>
</li>
<li>
<font size="3">Leave the patch in its sealed wrapper until you are ready to put it on. Tear the wrapper open carefully. NEVER CUT the wrapper or the patch with scissors. Do not use any patch that has been cut by accident. </font>
</li>
<li>
<font size="3">The patient instructions will show the body areas where you can wear the patch. When putting on each new patch, choose a different place within these areas. Do not put the new patch on the same place you wore the last one. Be sure to remove the old patch before applying a new one.  Only one patch should be worn at a time.</font>
</li>
<li>
<font size="3">Do not put the patch over burns, cuts, or irritated skin.  Avoid putting the patch on areas where the skin is hairy, oily, scared, or calloused, or where it could be rubbed off by tight clothing. After you apply the patch, press it down with your fingers and the palm of your hand to make sure it sticks to your skin.</font>
</li>
<li>
<font size="3">Put on a new patch if the old one has fallen off and cannot be reapplied. </font>
</li>
<li>
<font size="3">This medicine should come with a Medication Guide. Ask your pharmacist for a copy if you do not have one. </font>
</li>
<li>
<font size="3"><b>Missed dose: </b>If you forget to wear or change a patch, put one on as soon as you can. If it is almost time to put on your next patch, wait until then to apply a new patch and skip the one you missed.  Do not apply extra patches to make up for a missed dose. </font>
</li>
<li>
<font size="3">Store the patches at room temperature in a closed container, away from heat, moisture, and direct light.  Do not store this medicine outside of its sealed pouch.</font>
</li>
<li>
<font size="3">Fold the used patch in half with the sticky sides together.  Throw any used patch away so that children or pets cannot get to it. You will also need to throw away old patches after the expiration date has passed. </font>
</li>
</ul><p><b><font size="4">Drugs and Foods to Avoid:</font></b>
<br>
<b><font size="3">Ask your doctor or pharmacist before using any other medicine, including over-the-counter medicines, vitamins, and herbal products.</font></b></p><ul>
<li>
<font size="3">You <b>must</b> avoid many other medicines while you are using selegiline. These medicines used together could cause serious health problems, including death. <b>Ask your doctor before you use any other medicine. </b>You may need to wait 1 to 5 weeks before you can use other medicines.</font>
</li>
<li>
<font size="3">Do not use selegiline if you have used an MAO inhibitor within the past 14 days. Do not use this medicine if you are also using medicine to treat depression (including an SSRI, SNRI, or TCA), narcotic pain medicine (including meperidine, tramadol, or methadone), dextromethorphan, or carbamazepine. This is not a complete list.</font>
</li>
<li>
<font size="3">Other medicines can affect how selegiline works. Tell your doctor if you are also using buspirone or cough or cold medicine (including pseudoephedrine, phenylephrine, or phenylpropanolamine).</font>
</li>
<li>
<font size="3">Avoid foods and drinks that are high in tyramine, because your blood pressure could get dangerously high. Your doctor should give you a complete list. In general, do not eat anything aged or fermented, such as most cheese, most alcohol, cured meat (such as salami), sauerkraut, and soy sauce. Check the expiration dates on packages. Tyramine levels get higher as food gets older or if it has not been refrigerated properly. </font>
</li>
<li>
<font size="3">Do not drink alcohol while you are using this medicine.  Also limit how much caffeine you eat or drink.</font>
